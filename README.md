# Professional README Generator

## Purpose

The Professional README Generator is a command-line tool designed to streamline the creation of professional README files for your software projects. Writing comprehensive and well-organized READMEs is crucial for effective project communication and collaboration. This tool automates the process, allowing developers to focus more on coding and less on documentation.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript:** The primary programming language for building the functionality of the README generator.
- **Node.js:** An open-source, server-side runtime environment that executes JavaScript code, enabling the tool to run outside of a web browser.
- **Inquirer:** A powerful command-line user interface library for Node.js that facilitates interactive prompts, making it easy to gather information from the user to customize the README.
